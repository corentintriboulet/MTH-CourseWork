# Numerical analysis course work at Centrale Lyon

## Objectives
We will present basic numerical methods useful for engineering. Applications are given, which motivate the development of
such methods, together with a systematic analysis of the accuracy

##Keywords : 
Approximation, linear systems, numerical integration, differential equations, optimisation.

##Programme 
- Linear systems, eigenvalues.
- Optimization, non-linear equation.
- Interpolation, numerical integration.
- Numerical approximation of ordinary differential equations.
- Discretization of linear partial differential equations.
