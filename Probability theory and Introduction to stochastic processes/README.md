# Probaility theory and Introduction to stochastic processes course work at Centrale Lyon

## Objectives
The course will be given in English if necessary.
It is a mathematical advanced course which is strongly recommended to students who want to proceed in Mathematics
in France or abroad. In the following of teh cours of S7 we introduced in a rigourous way neaw notions such as characteristic
function, Gaussian processes, Law of 0-1, Borel-Cantelli lemma. NEw modelisation tools such as conditionnal expectation and
martingales, are studied.

## Keywords 
characteristic function, Gaussian processes, conditionnal expectation, stopping times, discrete
time martingales

## Programme 
- Characteristic functions
  
- Gaussian processes
  
- Random sequences, limit theorems
  
- Conditional expectation, martingales and stopping time
