# MTH-CourseWork
Mathematics course work at Centrale Lyon 

## Introduction

The skills acquired in the Mathematics Unit are transversal in the sense that they are applicable in the other courses of the
common core. It presents tools for solving abstract problem classes including formalization that involves deterministic or nondeterministic models. These models can describe phenomena appearing in physics, mechanics, economics, management, etc.
The courses offered provide a rigorous framework for analyzing and solving problems.

## Learning Outcomes
 • Use a mathematical concept or principle to describe a problem.
 • Model a random experiment using random variables.
 • Identify the different stages of the numerical simulation of physical phenomena.
 • Master the basic tools of mathematical analysis.
 • Use the basic functions of software for numerical calculation or statistics
