# Probability theory and Statistics coursework of Centrale Lyon


## Objectives
This first part of the course deals with the modelling with random variables. We introduce the notion of density. Some methods
of probability calculus, approximations and asymptotic theorems are studied. A important part of the course is devoted to the
numerical simulation with MATLAB. The second part of the course deals with statistics. The notions of estimators and tests are
introduced. A chapter is devoted to linear regression.
